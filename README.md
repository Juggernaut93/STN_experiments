# STN_experiments
This repository containes some toy experiments on a simple Spatial Transformer Network (STN) CNN.

Code is partially based on [this PyTorch tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/spatial_transformer_tutorial.html) by Ghassen Hamrouni.

Code was tested on Python 3.7, PyTorch 1.10, CUDA 10.2.
